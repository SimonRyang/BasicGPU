This simple Python example depends on the NumbaPro module, distributed
by Continuum Analytics: http://www.continuum.io/. NumbaPro can be
obtained by first installing the Anaconda Python distribution (free
for all), and subsequently the Anacaond Accelerate module (free for
academics).

The implementation in this archive also depends on the Numpy module,
which is distributed with Anaconda. As a result, default floating
point values are double precision. To modify the code for
single-precision GPUs, all floating point values must be explicitly
converted. In this case, the arrays 'paramGrid' and 'argMaxVals' would
be converted with the commmand:

paramGrid.astype(float32)
argMaxVals.astype(float32)

In addition, the two floating point arguments to 'maxPoly' must be
decorated with 'float32(.)'. Finally, the arguments of the 'maxPoly'
kernel must be changed from 'float64' to 'float32'.
