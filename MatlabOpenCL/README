This Matlab example depends on the Matlab OpenCL Toolbox:
https://code.google.com/p/opencl-toolbox/. Once the source code is
downloaded, follow the instructions to build the file
'openclcmd.mexa64', or the equivalent for your operating
system. Matlab can then utilize OpenCL functionality after the files
'openclcmd.mexa64', 'clbuffer.m', 'clkernel.m', 'clobject.m' and
'opencl.m' have been copied to the desire Matlab working
directory. Alternatively, the Matlab code that calls OpenCL can be
relocated to the 'opencl-toolbox' source directory that was downloaded
from the link above.

Note that to use OpenCL, you must have an OpenCL device drive platform
installed, as mentioned at
https://code.google.com/p/opencl-toolbox/wiki/Install_Guide. Different
platforms have different limitations regarding available hardware
(e.g. the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit only allows OpenCL to access NVIDIA
devices).
